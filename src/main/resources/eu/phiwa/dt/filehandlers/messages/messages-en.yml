#                 INSTRUCTIONS
#          for the usage of this file
#
# There are a few things you should know about when modifying this file.
# 
# 1. DO NOT USE TABS
#       They will corrupt the file and let your server crash.
# 2. INDENTATION IS IMPORTANT
#       It is important that you keep the indentation the way it is!
# 3. SINGLE QUOTES ARE NEEDED
#       The single quotes at the beginning and the end of each message are necessary.
# 4. APOSTROPHES
#       To use an apostrophe, you need to put two of them instead.
#       This means, you would put
#           ExampleMessage: 'I like Phiwa''s plugin.'
#       To get the message
#           I like Phiwa's plugin.
#       ingame.
# 5. COLOR-/FORMATTING-CODES ARE ALLOWED
#       You can use the normal color/formatting-codes used in Minecraft
#       (e.g. &a for green, &c for red and &f for white text).
#       You can find a full list of the codes at
#       http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes (they use an '§', use an '&' in DragonTravel!)
# 6. VARIABLES IN MESSAGES
#       All variables (marked with curly braces, e.g. {playername})
#       are automatically replaced with the correct value by the plugin ingame.
#       The available variables depend on the message, the default message (in the messages-en.yml)
#       always uses all variables available in the messages.
#       It is possible to leave variables out in a message.
# 7. DO NOT TOUCH THE 'File'-PARAGRAPH
#       It is only used by the plugin to check if you are running the latest version of the messages.yml.
#       Changing it might cause a crash of your server!
# 8. ENJOY THE PLUGIN
#       Should be quite obvious... ;)
#       Any feedback is appreciated, feel free to propose new features
#       and please report all bugs you find, otherwise I can't fix them. ;)
